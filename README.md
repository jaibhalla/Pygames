T'was just something I did to evaporate the boredom 

## 1. Tic Tac Toe
1. Basic graphics and alternating player flow. Starting Player is chosen randomly
2. Play Against the Machine!!! - Randomly Generated Moves 
3. Get Ready to Lose - MiniMax Algorithm Implementation 

## 2. Snake
This was pretty fun to make: I implemented the signature snake movement mechanics with a dictionary first time round but chose a simpler approach for teaching purposes

## 3. 2048
Looks pretty much the same as the original just without the winning and losing on-screen updates. If you lose, the screen will close and the terminal will print "You Lost"
